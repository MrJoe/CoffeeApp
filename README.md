# CoffeeApp
Multi-platform app to remember what drinks to get for your colleagues.

Currently this repo contains an Android and a Windows app. It was the intention to write everything in F# but Visual Studio's support for F# Windows Store apps is not as good as Xamarin Studio's F# support for Android (and iOS), so the Windows part is in C#.

Functionality yet to implement is a editable drink list (the current list is hard coded), a rest button, and an iOs app.
